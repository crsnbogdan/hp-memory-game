TITLE: Harry Potter Memory Game

VERSION NUMBER: 1.0

DESCRIPTION: A game that tests your memory using Harry Potter characters. You can either choose cards with characters from all of the houses, or an individual house. Each option (all characters, or a specific house) will have its own theme implemented using Material UI. The purpose is to try to click on as many cards as possible without clicking on the same one twice, as this will result in a game over.

 The use of React Hooks is fundamental for this project.
