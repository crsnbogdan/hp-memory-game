# Harry Potter's Memory Card Game

This game tests your memory skills using Harry Potter characters. You can either choose cards with characters from all of the houses, or an individual house. Each option will has its own theme implemented using Material UI. Clicking on the same card twice will result in a game over.

## Technologies Used
- React and React Hooks
- Tailwind CSS
- Material UI
## Lessons Learned

1. React

    - use the useState hook to initialize and set state, and pass the state down to children through props
    - use the useEffect hook to implement lifecycle methods for when a component is mounted, re-rendered and unmounted
     

2. Material UI

    - create custom themes using MUI's createTheme function
    - use the custom themes to dynamically style elements on a page
    - add inline style and stylize elements using MUI's props
